### Hi there 👋



Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on contribution to open source projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Kyverno Project, golang, and Linux.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with advanced Linux and shell scripting.
- 💬 Ask me about  Linux, Docker, and Kubernetes.
- 📫 How to reach me [LinkdIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivek-kumar-sahu-bb3a61195/).
- 😄 Pronouns: His/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to know the reason behind concepts. And more satisfying when I performed them practically.
